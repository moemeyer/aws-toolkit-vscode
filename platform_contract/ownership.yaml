# Ownership & Source of Truth
# Define who owns what and conflict resolution rules

ownership:
  # Example entry:
  # - entity: User
  #   source_of_truth: identity-service
  #   write_authority: identity-service
  #   read_replicas:
  #     - analytics-service (read-only cache)
  #   conflict_resolution: source_of_truth_wins
  #   sync_method: event-driven
  #   sync_sla: eventual_consistency_5min

  # - entity: Order
  #   source_of_truth: order-service
  #   write_authority: order-service
  #   conflict_resolution: last_write_wins_with_timestamp
  #   version_control: optimistic_locking

  # Add your ownership rules here

conflict_resolution_policies:
  source_of_truth_wins: "Always prefer the source of truth service"
  last_write_wins_with_timestamp: "Most recent timestamp wins"
  optimistic_locking: "Version-based conflict detection"
  manual_resolution: "Requires human intervention"
